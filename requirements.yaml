# Test links can include a source filter prefix (e.g. "windows@", "ubuntu@", "net8.0@") to restrict
# which test results count as evidence for a requirement. This is critical for platform and framework
# requirements - removing these filters invalidates the evidence-based proof.
#
# Source filter prefixes:
#   windows@TestName  - proves the test passed on a Windows platform
#   ubuntu@TestName   - proves the test passed on a Linux (Ubuntu) platform
#   net8.0@TestName   - proves the test passed under the .NET 8 runtime
#   net9.0@TestName   - proves the test passed under the .NET 9 runtime
#   net10.0@TestName  - proves the test passed under the .NET 10 runtime
